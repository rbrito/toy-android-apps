# Toy Android Apps

This repository is meant to host some toy Android apps for my learning
purposes.

In particular, I am trying to learn the development of Android apps with as
little GUI/IDEs as possible. Additionally, I am using as much of a vanilla
Debian *sid* installation as feasible.

From the Debian repositories, I am using Eclipse, openjdk 7, ant, and kvm.

The programs that I have not installed from the Debian archives are only the
Android plugin for Eclipse ("the ADT") and the Android SDK.
